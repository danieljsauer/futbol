# Futbol

Starter repository for the [Turing School](https://turing.io/) Futbol project.

## Iteration 1 Deliverable

1. We plan to meet everymorning at 8am MT/ 10am EST for standups to discuss the current state of the project.  In addition to project checkins we have our RETRO scheduled for Sunday.

2. We are utilizing our google jamboard to brainstorm our class methods and code design.  We are using GitHub Projects to track our progress.  We created a dedicated Slack channel for easy communication and will use that on an as-needed basis.

 3. We used jamboard to organize all of the methods within their respective classes.  We collectively discussed what made the most sense for each method in each class. 

 4. We used the Single Responsility Principle to organize classes in ways that fit the categories outline in the "code design" section within Iteration 1.  This has also been a topic of discussion in our standups.

## Iteration 3 Deliverable

### Things that went well 

1. Teamwork & Collaboration - Our group moved together as a cohesive unit for the duration of the project. All members were given room to speak and contribute, and at the end of the day this was truly "our" project. 

The biggest testement to the strong character of our group was the conflict resolution that was displayed on Friday/Saturday. Despite some friction that came about, the group was able to address the conflict in a mature and civil manner and continued to carry on as a team. This ultimately became a very positive moment that brought us together and served as the biggest learning experience of the project. 

Ultimately, our team stayed united and the final product was the result of a collaborative effort.

2. Social Element - Our group made room for personal stories, jokes, and tangents. Since this project took so much time, this was imperative to our successful collaborition as it created an environment that was prodcutive but also fun. We spent a lot of time on zoom calls together and this made it an enjoyable work experience. 

Also, since Turing is a huge chunk of our social interactions right now, it filled a crucial role in maintaining a positive state of mind. It was a pleasure getting to know one another.

3. Accountability - This was a demanding project for all of us, time and effort wise. Despite these demands, every member of the team continued to make our project a priority for the full week. Nearly every meeting was attended by each member of the group, and all members were present for every single scheduled work period. Along with near perfect attendance, each member followed through on their responsibilities diligently, ensuring that no balls were dropped and all tasks were successfully completed.

### Things that can be improved upon 

 1. Project Planning - We had a difficult time grasping the framework of this project and lost a lot time trying to organize our classes, files, and file names. To compound this, once we determined a direction, it did not work as we had anticipated which sent us back to the drawing board. We spent too long in an unproductive struggle at this stage of the project and would have been well served to reach out for assistance sooner than we did through mentors, codehelp, instructors, or any of the other many resources provided at Turing. 

 2. Sticking to TDD - Early on we lost our way and stopped adhering to TDD. This certainly contributed to the problems brought up in point 1. Our top down approach that we initally pursued was difficult to test and therefore we did not put much effort into making effective tests or rethinking our approach. TDD would have led us to the conclusion that our strategy was faulty sooner than we did. Fortunately, once we switched to a bottom-up (pyramid) approach, we got back on track with TDD and had a much easier time crafting methods because of it.

 3. Sticking to the schedule agreed upon in our DTR - While not a huge issue, we could have done a better job of sticking to the schedule we created in our DTR. Our poms were not as frequent as they should have been, and this commonly led us to taking poms individually rather than as a group, which took us out of our flow more than we realized. 

 ### Retro Summary 

 - Our group had established daily stand-ups at 8AM MST/10AM EST. We agreed to push back Sunday's standup to 10/12 and following its conclusion would conduct the retro.

 - All parties were in attendence at 10AM. Following a 15 minute stand-up we worked on a few lingering methods on the project until 11 AM. We then proceeded to the retro after a short pom.

 - Since Justin had previous experience with a group retro, we asked for his recomendation for the format to conduct our retro. He suggested a jamboard since it was familiar and effective. This was agreed upon unanimously by the other group members. 

 - We agreed that for the retro we would go over what went well and what could have been better. We based this off of the prompts given to us from iteration 3 and the link from smarttask.

 - We added most of our thoughts to the jamboard but we did conduct the retro primarilly verbally, since this was the primary method of communication we employed for the duration of the project.

 - We first went over the things that went well. The jamboard filled up quickly. 

 - This naturally segwayed into each member giving their perspective on the project as a whole. Thoughts and feedback were shared in a productive conversation. This was the most meaningful and insightful part of the retro.

 - After a lengthy conversation, we added the things that had not gone well to the jam board. Most of these points were brought up and discussed in the previous conversation but a few new points did come up and were discussed by the group. 

 - After another quick pom, we decided to add another slide for the retro summary. From there we strategized the final points we had to address for the project before we were ready to call it completed. We agreed to check in via slack and meet later that day if necessary, otherwise we would meet at 9 AM MST/ 11 AM EST for the final standup and for project presentation preparation.
